# Health-Tracker-Alex-Tan
This is an extracurricular project I completed from the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program.<br>
Using the Nutrionix API, the user can search for food and its corresponding calories.<br>
They can then track how many calories they consumed in total.<br>

## Installation
Clone the repo or download the zip file.<br>
Open the index.html file in any browser.<br>
Alternatively, use GitHub hosted version [here](https://atan009.github.io/Health-Tracker/).

## How to run
Use the search box in the top left to search for specific food.<br>
Click the search button to populate a list.<br>
A list of at most six related food items will appear.<br>
Click a button in the searched list to track it.<br>
Click a button in the calorie list to remove it.<br>
All tracked food data will be stored locally.<br>
